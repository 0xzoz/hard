### Overview

Dive into Hard, a distinctive Ethereum-based game where players engage in a strategic play of collecting and signing NFTs, termed as HARDs. Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin's halving mechanism and the real-world tenacity of "grit," the game combines the thrill of NFT collection with the satisfaction of earning "Grit" points through active participation and strategy.

## Inspiration

HARD draws its ingenious spirit from a melange of brilliant minds and their visionary creations:

- The luminary, **[Balajis](https://farcaster.com/balajis.eth)**, cast a spell with his enlightening discourse on the decentralized future. Dive into his insights [here](https://warpcast.com/balajis.eth/0x7df3ab).
  
- A nod to **[Josh Stark](https://farcaster.com/josh.stark)**, whose incisive [article](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0) paints a vivid picture of the blockchain landscape, inspiring many in the space.
  
- And, the audacious game, [Last Degen Standing](https://github.com/defijesus/last-degen-standing), masterminded by **[DefiJesus](https://farcaster.com/defijesus)**, further fueled our imagination. Listen to his captivating [cast](https://warpcast.com/defijesus/0x4523d9) for a deep dive.

These trailblazers not only paved the way but also kindled the fire of innovation, leading to the inception of HARD. To them, we tip our hats in gratitude and admiration.


### Core Concepts

1. **HARD Airdrops**: Active participants on the Ethereum blockchain can look forward to receiving unique HARDs through airdrops. The initial airdrop might distribute, for instance, 50 HARDs. After specific intervals (e.g., every 10 airdrops), this number halves, continuing until it reaches a minimal limit (e.g., 1 HARD).

2. **Signature Collection**: Owning a HARD opens the gateway to seek signatures from other HARD holders. Each unique signature not only amplifies the HARD's value but also strengthens the player's position in the game.

3. **Grit Points**: Being on the signing end of a HARD fetches you Grit points. These points mirror a player's contribution and engagement in the HARD ecosystem.

4. **Burn with Precision**: Grit burning introduces a strategic twist. Only players who've signed a specific HARD can burn their Grit points, making every decision in the game consequential.

### Contracts Breakdown

1. **HARD Management Contract**: The backbone of the game, this contract manages the minting, airdropping, and overall dynamics of HARDs.
2. **Signature Management Contract**: This contract is the hub for all signature-related activities, from making signature requests to verifying and storing them.
3. **Grit Points Management Contract**: Aligning with the game's strategy, this contract oversees the minting and burning of Grit points based on HARD signatures.

### Gameplay Flow

1. **Be Active**: Your activity on the Ethereum blockchain is your ticket to HARD airdrops. The game's halving mechanism ensures that the early birds have an edge, but consistent engagement is key.
2. **Signature Hunt**: With a HARD in your arsenal, embark on a journey to collect as many unique signatures as possible. Every signature is a testament to your networking prowess.
3. **Sign & Shine**: By signing other players' HARDs, you not only help them but also earn Grit points for yourself, marking your active contribution.
4. **Strategic Grit Burning**: The power to burn Grit points is in the hands of those who've signed the corresponding HARD. This selective burning mechanism adds depth to gameplay strategy.

### The "Grit" Philosophy

In HARD, "Grit" is more than a point system. It symbolizes perseverance, dedication, and the relentless pursuit of long-term goals. Every Grit point you earn is a badge of your resilience and active participation.

### Looking Ahead

With its modular architecture, HARD is poised for future expansions. Be it new game mechanics, rewards, or interactions, there's always room for more excitement!
